      fullDescription: "Unrecognized villages in the Negev are settlements that are not officially recognized by the state, yet they have a rich history and strong communities. These villages face many challenges, including limited access to basic services such as education and healthcare.",
      appDescription: "The Negev Pulse App is designed to improve access to emergency services for unrecognized villages in the Negev. The app provides accurate geographic information, including village locations, access roads, and local services, to ensure that emergency teams can reach quickly and efficiently.",
      birAlHamam: {
        "name": "Bir Al-Hamam",
        "description": "General Background\n\nBir Al-Hamam is an unrecognized village located north of route 25 with 2600 inhabitants. The village is named after an ancient and famous water well 'Bir Al-Hamam'. Six ancient caves are in the village and until the 1970s people still lived in them. There are old huts, an ancient cemetery and six water cisterns in the village.\n\nInfrastructure and services\n\nThe village has one connection point to the main water pipe on route 25, 3 km distance from the village. The infrastructure for carrying the water was done privately by the residents on their expense and they bear the costs for its maintenance. One connection point is not enough for the whole village which results in low water pressure which forces the residents to accumulate water during the night in water tanks. The village is not connected to the national electricity grid and the residents use solar panels and generators.\n\nThere are no health and education services in Bir Al-Hamam. For their health needs the residents have to drive to Tel Sheva ‚Äì 8 km distance and about 20 minutes ride. The children attend school in the recognized village of Molada, 8 km distance and a 20 minutes ride. There are no paved roads in Bir Al-Hamam. In order to get to the main road two wadis are to be crossed. In the winter time the water in the wadis overflow and the residents cannot go in or out of the village.\n\nThreats\n\nBir Al-Hamam is an unrecognized village which faces the house demolition policy of the state authority, and part of its houses received demolition orders. According to the Be'er Sheva Metropolis Plan the village is within the area defined as 'designated regional recreation area' and therefore disqualifies the village for recognition. In addition, Route 6 is planned to go through the village and divide it in two. Residents of Bir Al-Hamam have ownership claims to the lands of the village. The residents of Bir Al-Hamam strive to get recognition as an agricultural village where the village is located today.\n\nTourism in the village\n\nBir Al-Hamam has a visitor center which offers food, accommodation, tours and jeep excursions to the unrecognized villages in the Negev. The center is operated by Naji Abu Zkeika. For details: 054-3652929."

      khasimZannih: {
        "name": "Khasim Zannih",
        "description": "General Background\nThe unrecognized village of Kha≈°im Zannih is home to some 2000 people and predates the establishment of the State of Israel. The village has important historical sites including an ancient cemetery from the period of the Ottoman Empire, a well that was filled in by the government, several ancient houses, and caves that were carved for storing crops. The village is named after Zannih, a righteous woman who is buried in the village. The hill on which the village stands is shaped like a woman's nose, and the village is consequently called Kha≈°im Zannih ‚Äì 'Zannih's nose'. In December 2021, the government decided to recognize three unrecognized villages, as part of the coalition agreement including among them, Kha≈°im Zannih.\n\nServices and infrastructure\nThere are no medical clinics or schools in the village, and residents must travel to Be'er Sheva or ≈†gƒ´b as-SalƒÅm to receive medical services or attend school. Since public transport is not frequent, many people avoid seeking medical treatment and there is a high dropout rate, particularly among girls. Most residents draw water from a designated spot on the main pipeline, near route 25, using makeshift plastic pipes while some, who live far from the main road, bring water to their homes using tanks.\nThreats\nThe village is unrecognized, but according to Be'er Sheva Metropolitan Plan, its location in a 'rural agricultural area', makes it viable for recognition. However, the village faces a double threat as both Route 6 (the trans-Israel Highway) is planned to run through part of the village and to cover a significant part of it, while other parts of the village have been designated for forestation."

      wadiAlMsas: {
        "name": "Wadi Al-Msas",
        "description": "General Background\nWƒÅdi al-M≈°a≈° is located north of the Negev junction with 700 residents. The name of the village derives from WƒÅdi al-M≈°a≈°, a stream which runs in the area. Most of the residents are internally displaced citizens who were transferred by the government from the western Negev area in the 1950s. The residents of the village own lands in the Halutza area.\nServices and Infrastructure\nThere are no education services and no health services in the village. The children attend school in WƒÅdi an-Na øam, 20 km distance from the village, about half an hour drive. Due to the difficulty to access the village the residents have to drive the children to the main road from where they are picked up by the school bus. The high school children attend school in the Bedouin town ≈†gƒ´b as-SalƒÅm, 30 km distance and half an hour drive. For health services the residents have to drive to ≈†gƒ´b as-SalƒÅm or Yeruham ‚Äì 20 km distance from the village. No paved roads exist in the village and in times of heavy rains there is no way to move in the village. Moreover, the bus stops on the main road were cancelled when the road was widened. The village has no connection to water supply although the main pipe of Mekorot runs 2 km from the village. Therefore, water supply is by water tanks which are being filled 8km away from the village. WƒÅdi al-M≈°a≈° is not connected to the national electric grid and the residents use solar panels in order to produce electricity on their own.\nThreats\nWƒÅdi al-M≈°a≈° is an unrecognized village and according to The Be'er Sheva metropolis plan is located in a 'desert scenic region' and therefore cannot be recognized. The village is within the jurisdiction of Ramat Hanegev regional council but does not receive any services from this council. The state wants to move the residents to the Bedouin town of ≈†gƒ´b as-SalƒÅm, as part of a larger plan to move the nearby village of WƒÅdi an-Na øam. The residents' livelihood is agriculture and as such they want to be recognized in their present location. The residents don't want to move and live in a town and wish to continue living their rural life. House demolitions occur now and then and in view of the threats by the authorities that the costs of demolition will be borne by the owners, some residents have demolished their own homes. *Other forms of writing: Wadi al-Mshash, Wadi al-Mashash, Wadi Mshash, Wadi Mashash."

      khirbitAlWatan: {
        "name": "Khirbit Al-Watan",
        "description": "General background\nKhirbit al-Watan is an unrecognized village situated south of route 31 with 3,200 residents. The village precedes the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 and its name is derived from a well known ruin - Khirbit al-Watan. The village has a cemetery which was established before 1948 and some water cisterns that serve the residents until today.\nInfrastructure and services\nKhirbit al-Watan has few connection points to the main water pipe on route 31, 4 km distance from the village. The villagers arranged privately the infrastructure for the water transportation and bear the costs for its maintenance. While the school and health clinic in the village are connected to the national electric grid, the residents' homes are not connected and the residents are using solar panels and generators. Khirbit al-Watan has a primary and middle school and for high school the children go to ·∏§≈´rah, a distance of 7 km and half an hour drive from the village. There is a health clinic of 'Clalit' in the village. There are no paved roads in Khirbit al-Watan. According to government resolution 724 of 2009, a road to the school and the health clinic was to be paved in 2013, however so far this hasn't been done.\nThreats\nAccording to Be'er Sheva Metropolitan Plan Khirbit al-Watan is located in an area defined as a combined rural and agricultural area and therefore granting recognition to the village is possible. However, a plan for a new road connecting Be'er Sheva and Arad will run through the village. The residents of Khirbit al-Watan have ownership claims to the lands of the village, claims that haven't reached yet the courts. The village is facing the policy of house demolitions and some homes were served with demolition orders. The residents offer two possibilities for recognition of the village: One, expanding the outline plan of the neighboring recognized village as-Sayyid incorporating Khirbit al-Watan in its boundaries. Two, granting Khirbit al-Watan recognition as an independent rural-agricultural village."

      alMsaadiyyah: {
        "name": "Al-Msa øadiyyah",
        "description": "General Background\nAl-MsƒÅ øadiyyah is an unrecognized Bedouin village north of the planned town of al-Lagiyyih. It has existed in its current location since before the founding of Israel, and today contains around 700 residents. It is named after the Abu MsƒÅ øad family from whom the residents originally purchased their lands. The area contains caves and water cisterns which have served the villagers in the past.\nServices and Infrastructure\nThere are no schools in al-MsƒÅ øadiyyah. The students are bussed daily to al-Lagiyyih, 2.5 km away. The village does not have any health services, and the villagers must travel to al-Lagiyyih for clinic visits. After many years in which the village was not connected to water, a water point was recently installed for the villagers near their houses. However, the village is still not connected to electricity and the villagers use solar panels and generators to supply their own electricity. The village has no paved roads.\nThreats\nAl-MsƒÅ øadiyyah is one of the unrecognized villages under threat by the District Master Plan, according to which a forest area is to be planted in its place. Since the village is unrecognized, its houses are routinely demolished by the State. The villagers have ownership claims on the properties they live on, and will accept two options: either that the Master Plan for al-Lagiyyih will be expanded northwards, and their village be recognized as an agricultural settlement included in the town; or else that al-MsƒÅ øadiyyah be recognized as an independent agricultural village."

      alGharrah: {
        "name": "Al-Garrah",
        "description": "General Background\n\nThe village of al-ƒ†arrah is an unrecognized village, located 17 km east of Be'er-Sheva, south of Route 31, with a population of 2,000. al-ƒ†arrah is an historic village settled before the establishment of the State of Israel. The meaning of the word 'Ajar' in Arabic is someone or something whose forehead is dyed white, and the village is so named because it sits on a white hill-top. There are some ancient stone houses (Baika), wells and caves that were used to store crops in the village.\n\nServices and Infrastructure\n\nThere is one functioning medical clinic in the village but residents who are not clients of 'Meuchedet' HMO, must drive to the township of ·∏§≈´rah in order to receive medical care. There are no schools in the village and pupils must travel to the nearby village of Tla'a Rashid (al-Atrash). High school students travel all the way to ·∏§≈´rah or Ga·π£ir as-Sirr. There is only one kindergarten in the village that cannot serve all the children of al-ƒ†arrah, therefore, some of them travel daily to Tla'a Rashid.\n\nThe village has a few connection points to the main water pipe, along Route 31, 7 km from the village. The residents have to install the pipes at their own expense in order to gain access to water. Some of the residents transport water via water tanks at very high costs. Transferring water in tanks also lowers the quality of the water. The village is not connected to the national electricity grid, and its residents use solar panels or generators, while some of them have no electricity at all. There are no paved roads in the village and access to and from al-ƒ†arrah is extremely difficult.\n\nThreats\n\nal-ƒ†arrah is an unrecognized village. According to the Be'er-Sheva Metropolitan Plan, it is located in a 'metropolitan leisure / forest and afforestation' zone. Researcher Talma Duchan, who investigated objections to the Plan, recommended recognition of the village in 2010, alongside 13 other unrecognized villages. However, the Prime Minister Office appealed her recommendation and it was eventually denied. House demolitions in the village occur every once in a while, and some of the houses in al-ƒ†arrah are subject to demolition orders. The residents of the village live on lands to which they claim ownership. They also claim ownership to other lands outside the village. The residents want the State of Israel to recognize their village in its current location and on their own lands."

      alBatil: {
        "name": "Al-Batil",
        "description": "The village of Al-Batl is an unrecognized village situated south of Rahat. With the expansion of the southern quarter of Rahat, the village has in fact situated inside the city. There are about 1,350 inhabitants, who had arrived to the present location in 1948, having been removed by the state from the area of Ofakim. The village is named after a pool that existed in the land of the Al-Batl family, before the foundation of the state.\n\nServices and Infrastructure\n\nThere are no education and health services in the village. These services are provided only in the town of Rahat, about 5 km away from the village centre and ten minutes ride.\n\nThe inhabitants of Al-Batl obtain water from a pipe they had drawn themselves on their own expense from Rahat, and for which they pay the maintenance costs. The village is not connected to the electric grid and the inhabitants use generators.\n\nThreats\n\nThe main threat to the village is the expansion of the city without paying attention to the villagers and their needs. In 2007 the family was promised plots in Complex 4, but when the families came to demand theirs in 2014 they were told that the plots had already been marketed to other families from the city of Rahat. Because the Israel Lands Administration began marketing plots, every home in the village that interfered with development was destroyed. The state is interested in demolishing the village completely and therefore has been subjected to increasing house demolitions in recent years.\n\nFor example, on March 20, 2019, 5 houses were demolished one morning, which were households for about 60 people, and these were forced to move to another neighborhood and rent temporary houses there. In addition, an incitement and defamation campaign was carried out against the family by the Minister of Agriculture, Uri Ariel, who accused the members of the al-Ataika family of criminality and obstruction of the city's development. Residents want the State to recognize the village as an agricultural neighborhood within Rahat so they can continue to maintain their way of life, and oppose the state's proposal to give them plots of minimal size. They are also willing to compromise on smaller agricultural plots if this leads to the issuance of permits and infrastructure to the villagers, so that they can live their lives quietly and receive their full civil rights."

There is a plan to construct a military base near the village.
